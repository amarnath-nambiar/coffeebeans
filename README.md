# README

Your task is to create a simple web-based application using Ruby on Rails (RoR) that
integrates with the iterable.com API. The application will have two buttons, each responsible
for creating a different event associated with a user. After the events have been created, the
application should search through them, and for every Event B, an email notification should
be sent via iterable.com API.
